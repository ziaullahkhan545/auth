# Auth Repository

Welcome to the Auth repository! This repository contains various authentication and authorization methods implemented with Node.js, Express, and MongoDB. Each method is organized into its own directory for easy access and implementation. 

## Authentication Methods

This repository includes the following authentication methods:

1. **HTTP Basic Authentication**  
   A simple authentication scheme built into the HTTP protocol.

2. **JWT (JSON Web Token) Authentication**  
   A stateless authentication method that uses tokens to securely transmit information between parties.

3. **Session-Based Authentication**  
   A traditional authentication method that uses server-side sessions to manage user state.

Each method is contained in its own directory with example code and instructions on how to integrate it into your project.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed:
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (LTS version recommended)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (comes with Node.js)
- [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/community) (for MongoDB integration)

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/auth.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the directory of the authentication method you want to use:**

   ```bash
   cd auth/[authentication-method]
   ```

3. **Install the dependencies:**

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

4. **Set up your environment variables:**

   Create a `.env` file in the root of the directory and add the necessary configuration. For example:

   ```env
   MONGODB_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/your-database
   JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret
   ```

5. **Run the application:**

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

   This will start the Express server and make the authentication method available for use.

## Usage

### HTTP Basic Authentication

To use HTTP Basic Authentication, navigate to the `http-basic-auth` directory. You will find an example implementation in `server.js` and a brief guide in `README.md` within the directory.

### JWT Authentication

To implement JWT Authentication, go to the `jwt-auth` directory. Check the `server.js` file and the `README.md` in the directory for setup instructions and code examples.

### Session-Based Authentication

For Session-Based Authentication, navigate to the `session-auth` directory. Follow the instructions in `server.js` and `README.md` for configuration and usage details.
